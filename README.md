# Udacity FEND: Website Performance Optimization
This project required researching factors that impact website performance and applying optimization techniques to improve page rendering and function for an existing portfolio. Grunt was used for building the project and site performance was measured with Chrome DevTools and [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). 

## Getting Started
You can find Udacity's project repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio.git) and the project rubric [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/16/view).    

1. Download the files located in "project3" from the Github public repository located  [here](https://github.com/ahvar/frogger_arcade_game.git).
2. Launch with your preferred browser by double-clicking the 'index.html' file located in the project3 folder. 
3. Play game! (Quit game by closing window)

## Playing Frogger
The computer arrow keys allow you to move _left_, _right_, _up_, or _down_. Use the computer arrow keys to move your character across the road, avoiding the bugs moving across the screen.  If you are "hit" by a bug the game will reset.  When you reach the water on the othe side of the road, the game will reset.

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

* [Measuring with Navigation Timing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/measure-crp.html "nav timing api"). We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
